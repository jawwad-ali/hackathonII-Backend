## Prompt

Execute T004, T005 AND T006

## Response snapshot

Successfully completed three setup tasks from Phase 1 (Environment & Boilerplate):

**T004: Create src/ directory structure**
- Created `src/` directory with all required subdirectories for modular organization:
  - `src/agents/` - OpenAI Agents SDK agent implementation
  - `src/api/` - FastAPI routes and schemas
  - `src/mcp/` - MCP client integration
  - `src/streaming/` - ChatKit streaming implementation
  - `src/observability/` - Structured logging and metrics
  - `src/resilience/` - Circuit breaker and retry logic

**T005: Create .env.example file**
- Created comprehensive environment configuration template with:
  - Gemini API configuration (API key, base URL, model: gemini-2.5-flash)
  - MCP server configuration (command, args, timeout)
  - Application settings (host, port, log level)
  - Circuit breaker thresholds (MCP: 5 failures/30s, Gemini: 3 failures/60s)
  - Performance configuration (max input: 5000 chars, request timeout: 30s, max connections: 100)

**T006: Create .gitignore file**
- Created Python-specific .gitignore with patterns for:
  - Environment files (.env, .venv/)
  - Python bytecode and build artifacts (__pycache__/, *.pyc, dist/, build/)
  - Testing and coverage files (.pytest_cache/, .coverage)
  - IDE files (.vscode/, .idea/, *.swp)
  - Logs and temporary files
  - Docker override files

All three tasks marked as [X] completed in tasks.md.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Established project structure foundation for AI Agent Orchestrator implementation
- 🧪 Tests: None (setup tasks only - no test files required)
- 📁 Files: Created 3 files (.env.example, .gitignore, src/ with 6 subdirectories), updated 1 file (tasks.md)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Continue with T007-T011 to complete Phase 1 (FastAPI app, config, Docker setup)
- 🧠 Reflection: Clean execution of parallel-capable setup tasks. Directory structure aligns with plan.md architecture (observability/, resilience/ modules per clarifications). .env.example includes all required configuration parameters from data-model.md.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - all tasks executed successfully
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Manual verification PASS (directory structure confirmed via ls, files created with expected content)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.implement execution
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Continue sequential task execution for remaining Phase 1 tasks (T007-T011)
